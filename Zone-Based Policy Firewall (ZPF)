Part 1: Verify Basic Network Connectivity 
Verify network connectivity prior to configuring the zone-based policy firewall. 
Step 1: From the PC-A command prompt, ping PC-C at 192.168.3.3. 
Step 2: Access R2 using SSH. 
a. From the PC-C command prompt, SSH to the S0/0/1 interface on R2 at 10.2.2.2. Use the username 
Admin and password Adminpa55 to log in. PC> ssh -l Admin 10.2.2.2
b. Exit the SSH session. 
Step 3: From PC-C, open a web browser to the PC-A server. 
a. Click the Desktop tab and then click the Web Browser application. Enter the PC-A IP address 
192.168.1.3 as the URL. The Packet Tracer welcome page from the web server should be displayed. b. 
Close the browser on PC-C.

Part 2: Create the Firewall Zones on R3 
Note: For all configuration tasks, be sure to use the exact names as specified.
Step 1: Enable the Security Technology package. 
a. On R3, issue the show version command to view the Technology Package license information. 
b. If the Security Technology package has not been enabled, use the following command to enable the 
package. 
R3(config)# license boot module c1900 technology-package securityk9 
c. Accept the end-user license agreement. 
d. Save the running-config and reload the router to enable the security license. 
e. Verify that the Security Technology package has been enabled by using the show version command. 
Step 2: Create an internal zone. Use the zone security command 
to create a zone named IN-ZONE. R3(config)# zone security 
IN-ZONE 
R3(config-sec-zone) exit
Step 3: Create an external zone. Use the zone security command to 
create a zone named OUT-ZONE. 
R3(config-sec-zone)# zone security OUT-ZONE R3(config-sec-
zone)# exit

...............

Part 3: Identify Traffic Using a Class-Map 
Step 1: Create an ACL that defines internal traffic. 
Use the access-list command to create extended ACL 101 to permit all IP protocols from the 192.168.3.0/24
source network to any destination. 
R3(config)# access-list 101 permit ip 192.168.3.0 0.0.0.255 any

Step 2: Create a class map referencing the internal traffic ACL. 
Use the class-map type inspect command with the match-all option to create a class map named IN-
NETCLASS-MAP. Use the match access-group command to match ACL 101. 
R3(config)# class-map type inspect match-all IN-NET-CLASS-MAP
R3(config-cmap)# match access-group 101
R3(config-cmap)# exit

................

Part 4: Specify Firewall Policies 
Step 1: Create a policy map to determine what to do with matched traffic. Use the 
policy-map type inspect command and create a policy map named IN-2-OUT-PMAP. 
R3(config)# policy-map type inspect IN-2-OUT-PMAP
Step 2: Specify a class type of inspect and reference class map IN-NET-CLASS-MAP. 
R3(config-pmap)# class type inspect IN-NET-CLASS-MAP
Step 3: Specify the action of inspect for this policy map. 
The use of the inspect command invokes context-based access control (other options include pass and 
drop). 
R3(config-pmap-c)# inspect
%No specific protocol configured in class IN-NET-CLASS-MAP for inspection. All 
protocols will be inspected. Issue the exit command twice to leave config-pmap-c mode and 
return to config mode. 
R3(config-pmap-c)# exit
R3(config-pmap)# exit

........

Part 5: Apply Firewall Policies 
Step 1: Create a pair of zones. 
Using the zone-pair security command, create a zone pair named IN-2-OUT-ZPAIR. Specify the source and 
destination zones that were created in Task 1. 
R3(config)# zone-pair security IN-2-OUT-ZPAIR source IN-ZONE destination 
OUTZONE
Step 2: Specify the policy map for handling the traffic between the two zones. 
Attach a policy-map and its associated actions to the zone pair using the service-policy type inspect
command and reference the policy map previously created, IN-2-OUT-PMAP. 
R3(config-sec-zone-pair)# service-policy type inspect IN-2-OUT-PMAP
R3(config-sec-zone-pair)# exit
R3(config)# 
Step 3: Assign interfaces to the appropriate security zones.

Use the zone-member security command in interface configuration mode to assign G0/1 to IN-ZONE and 
S0/0/1 to OUT-ZONE. 
R3(config)# interface g0/1
R3(config-if)# zone-member security IN-ZONE
R3(config-if)# exit
R3(config)# interface s0/0/1
R3(config-if)# zone-member security OUT-ZONE R3(config-if)# 
exit

[4:17 pm, 19/3/2025] Ankita: Part 6: Test Firewall Functionality from IN-ZONE to OUT-ZONE 
Verify that internal hosts can still access external resources after configuring the ZPF. 
Step 1: From internal PC-C, ping the external PC-A server. 
From the PC-C command prompt, ping PC-A at 192.168.1.3. The ping should succeed. 
Step 2: From internal PC-C, SSH to the R2 S0/0/1 interface. 
a. From the PC-C command prompt, SSH to R2 at 10.2.2.2. Use the username Admin and the password 
Adminpa55 to access R2. The SSH session should succeed. 
b. While the SSH session is active, issue the command show policy-map type inspect zone-pair 
sessions on R3 to view established sessions. 
R3# show policy-map type inspect zone-pair sessions
policy exists on zp IN-2-OUT-ZPAIR
Zone-pair: IN-2-OUT-ZPAIR

Step 3: From PC-C, exit the SSH session on R2 and close the command prompt window. 
Step 4: From internal PC-C, open a web browser to the PC-A server web page. 
Enter the server IP address 192.168.1.3 in the browser URL field, and click Go. The HTTP session should 
succeed. While the HTTP session is active, issue the command show policy-map type inspect zone-pair 
sessions on R3 to view established sessions. 
Note: If the HTTP session times out before you execute the command on R3, you will have to click the Go
button on PC-C to generate a session between PC-C and PC-A.
